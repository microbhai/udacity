## Udacity Data Analytics Nano Degree: Project 5

### By - Akhil Sharma

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of
the data analysis process. In this project I have performed analysis and
visualization of data available from Ford GoBike, a bay area bike share
system, to get insight into bike trip patterns. 

### Dataset
The data has information about various bike trips taken by consumers and subscribers at various
times for the day. The data spreads over past 2 years and each data row
has information about the starting station, ending station, start time,
end time, trip duration, user type, user gender, user's birth year. It
is good amount of data, with information on close to 3-4 million rides.


### Summary of Findings:

1. Ford GoBike system is growing very fast and in past 2 years number of
trips have grown more than 4 times. 
2. 7 AM to 10 AM and 4 PM to 7 PM are the busiest hours of the day observing highest trip counts 
3. 8-9 AM and 4-5 PM is the peak hour for GoBike trips 
4. Weekdays observer a lot more trips compared to weekends 
5. For 11 AM to 3 PM time window, weekends observe more trips than weekdays 
6. Male riders take shorted duration trips 
7. Female riders take longer duration trips 
8. Mean trip duration for most riders is less than 1000 seconds 
9. For Subscriber users, the mean ride time is around 500 seconds 
10. Trips by male riders are approximately 3 times as many as those made by female riders 
11. Most of the riders are in age group 30-40

### Key Insights for Presentation
1. Data gives us birth year information, which was used to calculate user's age at the time of taking the trip
2. Year and month olumns were created from the start time column so that I could check the growth of GoBike in terms of trip count increase month over month
3. There are 2 types of riders, Subscriber who take small duration trips everyday and Customers who take longer trips. 89% of the trips are by Subscribers.
4. Male rider take more trips than female riders
